Attached is a fairly Simple Goldbach Conjecture Algorithm that expresses any even int >= 2 as the sum of two primes. I wrote this code for a presentation at Pace University. All code is my own. I will be adding many other projects to my github so feel free to check back or email me at MikeCapezzuto88@gmail.com if you have any questions, or would like to see some more complex projects that I've worked on. The code also contains a simple method for testing if an integer is prime or not.

Please ignore the embarrasing state of my GitHub profile, as I've only just recently learned how to use it :)

The Goldbach Conjecture states that, for any positive even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. This code finds all such sums for integers up to Integer.MAX_VALUE = 2^31-1.
