# Goldybachs

Attached is a fairly Simple Goldbach Conjecture Algorithm that expresses any int as the sum of two primes, for all possible combinations. I wrote this code for a presentation at Pace University. All code is my own. I will be adding many other projects to my github so feel free to check back or email me at MikeCapezzuto88@gmail.com if you have any questions, or would like to see some more complex projects that I've worked on.

Please ignore the embarrasing state of my GitHub profile, as I've only just recently learned how to use it :)
