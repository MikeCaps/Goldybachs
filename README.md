Attached is a fairly Simple Goldbach Conjecture Algorithm that expresses any int as the sum of two primes, for all possible combinations. I wrote this code for a presentation at Pace University. All code is my own.

Please ignore the embarrasing state of my GitHub profile, as I've only just recently learned how to use it :)
